So, you want to run devenv or cl from Cygwin.  Welp, it was a long and arduous
process, but it is hookupable.  That's the technical term for pain-in-the-ass.

Okay, so Cygwin is pretty smart and will take all variables from the environment
that it was launched in and magically provide them to bash, which is very useful
for this purpose, since vsvars32.bat basically just sets environment variables.

So instead of launching from C:\tools\cygwin\bin\mintty.exe we're going to take
a page from the Cygwin cookbook and launch it from a batch file.

Cygwin ships with a default C:\tools\cygwin\Cygwin.bat, which you can add this:

call "%VS110COMNTOOLS%vsvars32.bat"

line to.

Note that %VS110COMNTOOLS% is a Windows environment variable that gets
set to the root of the Visual Studio installation path, presumably when you
install VS.  The 110 part is important, it corresponds to the version number
found in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Visual Studio XX.X\"  Yours may be different
than 110, for instance 140 for 14.0 or 80 for 8.0

So now that we've got the good shit loaded into our batchfile environment we're
going to need to start a sane terminal emulator and load bash into it.

Changing the default line (I think it just calls /bin/bash --login -i) to this:

C:\tools\cygwin\bin\mintty /bin/bash --login

Which fires up mintty, loads bash and logs us in (so .bash_profile get sourced).


Almost done; now we need a way to quickly launch this stupid thing.  If you've
got a method that you prefer all the power to you, but what I did was create a
shortcut to the batchfile and pin it to the taskbar.

First, create a shortcut.  Now you have to RMB->properties and edit the target
field to be cmd.exe /C "path/to/batfile", where path/to/batfile SHOULD be what's
there already.  Now just drag it onto the taskbar and launch away!
