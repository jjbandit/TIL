So, you want to run devenv or cl from Cygwin.

Okay, so Cygwin is pretty smart and will take all variables from the environment
that it was launched in and magically provide them to bash, which is very useful
for this purpose, since vsvars32.bat basically just sets environment variables.

So instead of launching from C:\tools\cygwin\bin\mintty.exe we're going to take
a page from the Cygwin cookbook and launch it from a batch file.

Cygwin ships with a default C:\tools\cygwin\Cygwin.bat, to which you can add this:

call "%VS110COMNTOOLS%vsvars32.bat"

Substitute the toolchain(s) you care about; you can add more than one of these
lines to add multiple versions of the toolchain.

Note that %VS110COMNTOOLS% is a Windows environment variable that gets
set to the root of the Visual Studio installation path, presumably when you
install VS.  The 110 part is important, it corresponds to the version number
found in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Visual Studio XX.X\"  Yours may be different
than 110, for instance 140 for 14.0 or 80 for 8.0

So now that we've got the good shit loaded into our batchfile environment we're
going to need to start a sane terminal emulator and load bash into it.

Changing the default line (I think it just calls /bin/bash --login -i) to this:

C:\tools\cygwin\bin\mintty /bin/bash --login

Which fires up mintty, loads bash and logs us in (so .bash_profile get sourced).


Almost done; now we need a way to quickly launch this stupid thing.  If you've
got a method that you prefer all the power to you, but what I did was create a
shortcut to the batchfile and pin it to the taskbar.

First, create a shortcut.  Now you have to RMB->properties and edit the target
field to be cmd.exe /C "path/to/batfile", where path/to/batfile SHOULD be what's
there already.  Now just drag it onto the taskbar and launch away!

Apparently, if your annoyed that a cmd window pops up every time you use the
shortcut, after pinning, you can open the shortcut at:

C:\Users\<User name>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch\User Pinned\TaskBar

and change the target path back to path-to-your-batch.  Didn't take time to
confirm though.

Also found another way of doing this, which is more representative of what's
actually happening here:
