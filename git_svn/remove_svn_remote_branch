After removing the [svn-remote "mybranch"] entry from git config:

git branch -d -r mybranch
rm -rf .git/svn/refs/remotes/mybranch

I also found an interesting way to automate this process for many branches.

# The docs also state it's also a good idea to remove the branches metadata at:

.git/svn/.metadata
